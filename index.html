      <h3>Project 1</h3>
      <p> THis project is a passion project of mine, 
        when i first started in the tech indursty i couldnt find the right space to talk to others, 
        not only regarding my explots in web devleping or as a software eniggnereing but
        my intrest in hardware and networking.
        As somone with out looking point view they would say its just all IT stuff? 
        when in realte so much more goes in to each tech job to make what we have today.
        Thats what im making LEXORA for its a site to connect fresh eyes looking in to the tech world
        wiether if you just want to chat about your intrest in tech or you want to buy or sell a piceic of tech you can get here.
        you think tech we have it here!.</p>
